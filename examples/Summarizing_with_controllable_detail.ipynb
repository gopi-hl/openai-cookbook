    "The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate how to summarize large documents with a controllable level of detail. If you give a GPT model the task of summarizing a long document (e.g. 10k or more tokens), you'll tend to get back a relatively short summary that isn't proportional to the length of the document. For instance, a summary of a 20k token document will not be twice as long as a summary of a 10k token document. One way we can fix this is to split our document up into pieces, and produce a summary piecewise. After many queries to a GPT model, the full summary can be reconstructed. By controlling the number of text chunks and their sizes, we can ultimately control the level of detail in the output."
